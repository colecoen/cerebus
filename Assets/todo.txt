PLAYER PHYSICS
 - Wall jump forces send character much further depending on timing of input
 - Don't allow to detach from wall until timer is met
 - Implement wall leap (input + wall jump)
 - Air physics are too fast
 - Fix / Implement Coyote timing + Input Buffering
 - Ensure ground / air jumps logic is correct (use jumps in certain scenarios)
 - Do something about reducing velocity if you hit your head or you barely clip a ledge
